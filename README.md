Atmosphere is a simple application displaying weather and air quality information. <br></br>
Weather information is courtesy of openweathermap.org<br></br>
Air quality is not yet implemented.<br></br>

Built using react.<br></br>
For now api requests are made directly from client side since there is no fast<br></br>
provider for server sides that's also free (probably gonna end up using heroku).<br></br>

Current Version - 0.2<br></br>

Version 0.3 - Air quality info, different city card views (compact/detailed)<br></br>
